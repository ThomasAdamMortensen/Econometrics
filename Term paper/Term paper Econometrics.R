# Okuns law? or philips law? https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/okuns-law.asp
# Okun = GDP and unemployment inverse relationship
# philips law unemployment and GDP inverse relationship

# VARS are made to estimate relationship between multiple quantities over time,
# meaning we can see how several quantities can be modeled using lags of itself and others.


# One example of such case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYRFYWNxX4c&ab_channel=JustinEloriaga

# Download data with 2 variables, GDP and unemployment or inflation from Statistics sweden.

# Then estimate VAR(P) of P lags and interpret coefs

# Do tests to check if assumptions are met, what P to choose and more.
# Such as KPSS and ADF and plotting/differencing to find I(D) for this data
# Check for cointegration.

# After models estimated, check residuals for normality/autocorrelation for assumptions and interpret

# Either keep it in script format or Rmarkdown/quarto or stay to script.

# Use latex to bind it all together in overleaf preferably.
